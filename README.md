# Flashcard
**Alpha software**
Flashcard is an Anki-style flashcard program that parses .csv files and tries to be as easy to use as possible.

## Usage
Add rows on the start screen and fill them in:
- left column: input word
- right column: definition

Import existing .csv files with 'Import' button.
**Csv files can only have 2 columns and need to use semicolons ** *(use Libreoffice Calc)*
Start a new session with 'Start'.
